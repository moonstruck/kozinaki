OpenStack Hybrid Cloud Driver

Kozinaki, an OpenStack hybrid cloud driver, is a piece of software used to enable complete instance lifecycle management in public clouds from within OpenStack using native Nova APIs and CLI. It enables the creation of OpenStack hybrid cloud with non-OpenStack public clouds. Hybrid driver is intended to be completely pluggable into OpenStack architecture without changing the code of the core OpenStack components.

Currently supports a subset of lyfecycle operations (launch, delete, start, stop, reboot, resize, snapshot) operations on AWS and Azure.

Full documentation on the project is constantly updated and is kept here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gk8M8zdwCuHNr4N-1d6YUbERLesxziiJfsL-njrERGY/edit?usp=sharing
